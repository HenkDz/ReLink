Re:Link - The Browser Interceptior

Re:Link is a browser that is not a browser. You can set it as your default browser and it will open links in different browsers based on predefined rules.

For example, it can open google.com in Chrome, msn.com in Edge, github.com in Firefox and youtube.com in Brave.

You can also fine tune rules to make same domain open in different browsers. For example, mail.google.com can open in Brave while google.com still opens in Chrome.
