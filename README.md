Re:Link - The Browser Interceptor

Re:Link is a desktop app that acts like a browser. When you set it as the default browser, it intercepts link requests from Email clients, desktop apps and other programs and open them in different browsers based on predefined rules.

For example, it can open google.com in Chrome, msn.com in Edge, github.com in Firefox and youtube.com in Brave.

You can also fine tune rules to make same domain open in different browsers. For example, mail.google.com can open in Brave while google.com still opens in Chrome.
